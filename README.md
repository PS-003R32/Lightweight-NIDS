# Lightweight-NIDS
This repository has three different phases for the development of the NIDS which are dated and stored in separate directories. Kindly read the `README` files of each one according to your requirements and follow along.<br>
This project uses a `raspberry pi zero 2w`, `ssd1306 oled display`, `1602 LCD display` for the nids console. This project is excellent for demonstration of a nids for your home network and also for simulation.

Follow the instructions in the seperate directories of the development of this project. Each one uses the same hardware but has different approach to achieve the `Network Intrusion Detection System`.<br>
