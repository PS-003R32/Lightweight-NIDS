# Lightweight-NIDS
This repository has three different phases for the development of the NIDS which are dated and stored in separate directories. Kindly read the `README` files of each one according to your requirements and follow along.<br>
This project uses a `raspberry pi zero 2w`, `ssd1306 oled display`, `1602 LCD display` for the nids console. This project is excellent for demonstration of a nids for your home network and also for simulation.

### Repository dir structure
- Simple-Python *[simplest one, can be run on any dev board. ts just a gimmick]*
- Random Forest classifier *[using scikit-learn, can be run on the zero 2w board flawlessly]*

[NOTE: YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE `armata-nids` [repo link](https://github.com/PS-003R32/armata-nids) REPOSITORY FROM MY PINS WHICH USES PYTHON3-SCAPY AND NEURAL NETWORK CLASSIFIER FOR THE NIDS DEVELOPMENT. USES MINIMAL HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS]

Follow the instructions in the seperate directories of the development of this project. Each one uses the same hardware but has different approach to achieve the `Network Intrusion Detection System`.<br>
